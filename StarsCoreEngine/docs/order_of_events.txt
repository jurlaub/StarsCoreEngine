scienceGain?	// by TechComboDiff,probability... called from several places, if happens blocks later chances. Calls {recalc ship costs/miniaturization; recalc planetary scanner reach/class; recalc defense ratio; recalc terraf bounds (possibly activating terraf for habs that had it "completed");  report new available items (or tag them for later reporting)

planetZeroed	// Planets hit that end up with 0 colonists become uninhabited (Player order -lower- determines whose packets hit first)
WormHoleDegrade	// even jump/vanish. Must actually happen before movement
WormHoleJiggle	// before movement, but hole.OldCoords = hole.Coords (before jiggle, in case a fleet exits thru)
gateFleet
fleetMove	// as per targeting, if not blocked by task (minelaying, waitLoading) or CE or W10 explosion. sortFleets?
 - fuelUsage calculation. If outOfFuel, change trip params	// if no fuel, set Warp=maxFree
 - actual movement <- possible minehit
 - fuelGen	// for survivors, only before WH jump or mine snare (speedbump or normal)
 - wormholeTrip	// uses oldCoords for entry & exit. Traveling in WH removes its 75% cloaks so if the end stays within other scanners range it stays visible.
 - possible minehit!?!?
// (fields reduce as they are hit, lowest # fleets hits mines first) fields hit become "scanned" if several fields overlap, random one hit?
tripGrowth	//IS, negative for AR. IS overflows to player owned planets. (normal growth is after this, so an IS can grow twice...)

// "stolen" PP packets still scan, since they still exist and have "speed"
