    Player Data

    players race file starts as <'race_name'.r1>
    > this establishes the basic race information that is generated by the RaceWizard
    RaceWizard data needs to be saved and referenced. 

    PRT Summary:
    >PRT ==> changes how species operate in some manner. typically acts as an augmentation
    >>> WM = extra hulls + tech, better invasion, better ship speed etc
    >>> SS = base stealth, extra tech, capture percent of research resources
    >>> JOAT = base pop higher, scout hulls have intrinsic pen scanners
    >>> IT = extra tech, jump cargo and pop through gates, better at gating, 2nd planets
    >>> PP 
    >>> SD 
    >>> HE 
    >>> IS 
    >>> AR 


    >LRT ==> chages how a species operate in a smaller manner
    >>> UR = ultimate recycling
    >>> IFE = Access two unique engines? no ramscoops
    >>> Double Shields = 
    >>> no pen scanners
    >>> 



    > Player object should track
    >> race file data
    >> habitable planets (list?)
    >> (list?) of fleets object ids 
    >> minefild list?
    >> tech levels
    >> ship designs
    >> player VC data
